# Metaheuristics-Project
Heuristics and metaheuristics implementation for the corresponding course at the MPRO

Add a descent at the end : selecct the vertices in random order and remove those which are not necessary (useful)

Maybe change the best solution if the current one has the same score as the best

Some methods aren't used, maybe delete them

Some vectors seem to be copied in the heuristic, that is not cool for complexity (but not really important also)
